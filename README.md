### Model Architecture

The Enhanced Generative Language Model uses:

- Rotary positional embeddings (RoPE)
- Pre-layer normalization
- Multi-head self-attention
- GELU activation functions
- Learned embeddings
- Advanced text generation strategies including:
  - Temperature scaling
  - Top-k and nucleus (top-p) sampling
  - Repetition penalty
